## Style Guidelines:

- Color Palette: A light scheme that conveys hope, growth, and clarity. The primary color will be a warm, encouraging green (HEX: #11AD3B) representing action and vitality. The background will be a very subtle, light green tint (HEX: #F2FAF2), providing a clean canvas. An accent color, a bright and distinct yellow-green (HEX: #ACEC54), will be used for secondary interactive elements or highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its modern, clean, and highly legible characteristics, ensuring clarity and professionalism suitable for informative content.
- Use crisp, modern outlined icons for actions (like sharing, search, heart) and navigational elements (like dropdown chevrons), consistent with the original page's minimalist approach.
- Implement a responsive two-column layout on larger screens, featuring main content on the left and a dedicated fundraising summary/action panel on the right. Prioritize clear hierarchy, generous spacing, and mobile-first adaptability.
- Incorporate subtle hover effects on interactive elements such as buttons and campaign cards. Utilize smooth transitions for the FAQ accordion sections and tab switches to enhance user experience without distraction.
